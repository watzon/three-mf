## Description

Extend internal data structures to include `path` and `UUID` fields for models, items, components, and builds.

## Details

- Update TypeScript interfaces/classes for Model, Item, Component, Object, and Build.
- Add optional `path: string` property where applicable.
- Add `uuid: string` property for entities requiring ST_UUID.
- Ensure type definitions align with XML parsing and serialization logic.

## Test Strategy

- Verify TypeScript type checks for presence of new fields.
- Ensure data flow from parser to model reflects new attributes correctly.
