## Description

Write unit and integration tests for parsing, data model, and serialization of production extension features.

## Details

- Create unit tests for parser enhancements (path and UUID attributes).
- Create unit tests for serializer enhancements and `.rels` generation.
- Add integration test to round-trip a sample production extension 3MF package.
- Use existing test framework and sample files from `docs/examples`.

## Test Strategy

- Ensure tests pass in `bun test`.
- Validate integration round-trip maintains attribute fidelity.
