## Description

Extract `<resources>` from the model part, including `<basematerials>` groups and `<object>` definitions, mapping IDs and verifying uniqueness.

## Details

- Parse `<basematerials>` elements and their `<base>` children
- Parse `<object>` elements:
  - Capture `id`, `type`, `pid`, `pindex`, `thumbnail`, `partnumber`, `name`
  - Distinguish between `mesh` vs `components` child
- Ensure resource IDs are unique
- Build in-memory structures for materials and objects

## Test Strategy

- `.3mf` with valid resources → expect correct data structures
- Duplicate material or object IDs → expect error
- Missing required attributes (`id`) → expect error 

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented the resources parser with the following features:
- Created `ObjectType` enum for object types
- Implemented interfaces for base materials and objects
- Added validation for object types and required attributes
- Enforced uniqueness of resource IDs
- Validated that objects have either mesh or components (but not both)
- Added detection of missing/conflicting properties
- Created comprehensive test suite with multiple test cases
- All tests pass successfully
