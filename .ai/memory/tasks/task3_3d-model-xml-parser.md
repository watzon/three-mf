## Description

Parse the `<model>` element in the 3D Model part, including attributes `unit`, `xml:lang`, `requiredextensions`, and enforce exactly one `<model>` element per document.

## Details

- Read the XML for the 3D Model part
- Parse attributes:
  - `unit` → ST_Unit enum
  - `xml:lang` → language code
  - `requiredextensions` / `recommendedextensions`
- Validate exactly one `<model>` element exists
- Report errors on missing/extra `<model>`

## Test Strategy

- Model XML with single `<model>` and valid attributes → parse success
- Multiple `<model>` elements → expect error
- Unsupported `unit` value → expect error 

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented the model parser with the following features:
- Created `Unit` enum for supported unit types
- Implemented `Model` interface to represent parsed data
- Added validation for unit values
- Added checks for exactly one `<model>` element
- Implemented parsing for extensions (required/recommended)
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- All tests pass successfully
