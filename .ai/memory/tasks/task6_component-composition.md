## Description

Implement `<components>` handling to compose objects by referencing `objectid` and applying 3D transforms to create combined models.

## Details

- Parse `<components>` lists from object definitions
- For each `<component>`:
  - Resolve referenced object by ID
  - Apply the `transform` matrix to its mesh or nested components
- Support nested component hierarchies
- Provide API to flatten composed objects into final meshes

## Test Strategy

- Single-level component composition → expect merged mesh
- Nested component hierarchy → expect correct transform chaining
- Missing `objectid` reference → expect error 

## Implementation Notes

- Created a `Matrix3D` class to handle 3D transformations with proper matrix math
- Implemented circular reference detection to prevent infinite loops in component hierarchies
- Added validation for component references, including checking that objects of type "other" are not referenced
- Implemented proper handling of triangle winding order when transformations flip orientation (negative determinant)
- Created comprehensive tests for both basic and complex component hierarchies
- Updated resources parser to properly extract component references and transforms
