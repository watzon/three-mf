## Description

Parse `<mesh>` elements into in-memory vertex (`Vec3[]`) and triangle arrays, enforcing manifold edges and consistent CCW orientation rules.

## Details

- Parse `<vertices>` into an array of `{x,y,z}` objects
- Parse `<triangles>` into index triples and optional per-vertex property indices
- Enforce:
  - Manifold edges (each edge shared by exactly 2 triangles)
  - Outward-facing normals (CCW vertex order)
- Provide functions for normal calculation and validation

## Implementation Notes

- Created a new `mesh.ts` module with data structures and parsing logic
- Implemented vertex and triangle parsing with validation
- Added manifold edge checking using an edge count map
- Added triangle orientation checking using normal direction
- Integrated with the resources module to attach meshes to object resources
- Added comprehensive test cases for various mesh configurations
- The validation is strict for 'model' and 'solidsupport' object types, but more permissive for other types

## Test Strategy

- Simple tetrahedron mesh → expect valid structure ✓
- Inverted triangle winding → expect orientation error ✓
- Non-manifold mesh → expect manifold violation error ✓
