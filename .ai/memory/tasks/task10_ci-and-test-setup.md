## Description

Configure the testing framework (`bun test`), write initial unit tests for the modules implemented so far, and set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on every push.

## Details

- Ensure `bun test` runs with no errors
- Write tests for:
  - OPC reader
  - Content Types & Relationships Parser
  - 3D Model XML Parser
- Add GitHub Actions YAML (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run `bun install` and `bun test`
- Enforce test coverage threshold in CI

## Test Strategy

- CI passes on good build
- Failing test causes CI to fail
- Validate coverage report reflects threshold
