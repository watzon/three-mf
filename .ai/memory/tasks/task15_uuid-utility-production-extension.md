## Description

Implement GUID generation utility to produce valid ST_UUID strings for build, items, objects, and components.

## Details

- Use a UUID library to generate RFC4122-compliant UUIDs (e.g., `bun add uuid`).
- Expose utility functions for generating and formatting UUIDs.
- Ensure uniqueness and validity according to ST_UUID pattern.

## Test Strategy

- Add unit tests to generate multiple UUIDs and verify pattern compliance.
- Ensure no collisions in quick successive calls.
